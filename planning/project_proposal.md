## Problem Statement

Insert your groups problem statement and target audience.

It takes students a long time to craft optimal schedules every semester. How can the process of creating optimal schedules for students be streamlined to reduce the time and resources required each semester?

## Description

What is the main purpose of your project? What are the key features your site has to offer its users? How will your targeted audience use your website?

Students have the ability to input their course details, enabling the generation of a schedule by utilizing information such as course timings and professors. The schedules are then constructed to align students with highly-rated professors in their respective fields. This process involves leveraging an API scraper that retrieves information from Rate My Professor, a platform dedicated to rating professors.
