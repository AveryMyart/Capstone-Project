## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.


This week, one notable success was our ability to stay on track and make significant progress towards completing our deadline. We efficiently tackled the tasks and managed to successfully develop our Minimum Viable Product (MVP).

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

This week, we encountered a challenge while relocating our files. Initially, we began the project using a React app instead of the Vite version, leading to some issues on our site due to missing dependencies. Despite this setback, we persevered and managed to overcome the obstacles, successfully completing the task and resolving the missing dependencies.

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

We are making good progress, and by the end of the day, we'll be on track to complete our MVP feature.

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

 The CSS workshop proved to be incredibly beneficial.I wish we had covered this topic before the capstone, as the workshop provided valuable insights that could have been even more advantageous if introduced earlier in the process.

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

 Currently, none of our user stories or features for the MVP are at risk. Looking ahead, we plan to focus on implementing our stretch features in the upcoming week.
